                We use logic to process the nature and the content of information, pertaining exchanges of informations7 within the bulk and at the margins of the social fabric. Customarily, all these exchanges involve global institutions in various ways related to macroscopic decision making procedures.

                Provided sufficiently precise, accurate, and reliable measuring tools we can, e.g., ask: how to measure the distance betweent individuals - individually from institutions, and that of individuals collectively from decision makers in the global agenda? Even more precisely, let us ask how to measure alignment between individualâ€™s natural tenden- cies and inclinations with respect to external sensorial and psychological stimulation, possibly in connection with macro-scale social dynamics?

                The distribution of Questions at different levels of abstraction, vertically and horizontally within the cur- rent society, by the means of a collective stimulation with real logic challenges which all face in relation to the external world, achieve solutions that are staring in front of us8 In the context of this contribution, we show how WE use simple questions to harness the clearest voice from individuals at all scales, beyond to political boundaries, building contstructively upon shared cultural knowledge and natural tendencies of con- scious connection within interactions.
