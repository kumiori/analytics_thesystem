              A kind of desire to create something physical or something beyond [the limitations of our minds], exploring all the possible forms of art or craftwork or collaborative work. If you resonate with this vision, you are welcome to join [our artistic residence]. It&lsquo;s a space that both excites and calms, offering opportunities for self-expression, growth, and various other experiences. Do you want to be a part of it? What do we seek to embrace? An intimate group of people who treat each other kindly and fairly, cherishing the space we share, and holding an earnest wish to co-create something better together.

              Now, what is needed in this moment? What remains to be done? We are just at the beginning, but the place is already here. We will strive to make it even better. Enthusiasm and [an open-minded] attitude are what we require. We need someone else to join us before we start engaging in individual work, but that doesn&lsquo;t mean it won&lsquo;t be extremely constructive. We can embark on a physical project that involves everyone, working toward a shared objective. It could be renovating the space, synchronizing our energies, checking the vibes, or even playing together before delving into more metaphysical endeavors.

              One idea is to begin by fixing things up, painting, and setting up a cozy dinner table where we can gather and talk about what we want to do as a group or individually. We can also engage in drawing little pictures, knowing that it doesn&lsquo;t have to be a grandiose masterpiece at the start. We can start small and gradually expand, collaborating whenever we want to. For instance, we could try a painting exercise using a huge canvas where we all contribute and complete each other&lsquo;s movesâ€”a truly collaborative and enjoyable experience.
