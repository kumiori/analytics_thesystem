                A kind of desire to create something
                something physical or something ....
                all the possible forms of art or craftwork
                or collaborative work then you are welcome to join
                it&lsquo;s a space that both excites and calms and 
                many other things

                enjoy? join? what do we subscribe to?

                An intimate group of people
                who treat each other kindly and fairly 
                and the space as well

                with an earnest wish to do/create something better together

                what&lsquo;s needed now? what&lsquo;s left to do?
                Just starting..


                The place is there, we will make it better
                we need enthusiasm and ... attitude.
                just need someone else

                before doing work that looks individual
                extremely constructive to do something physical
                that involves everyione with a shared objective
                renovation, sync, check vibes, play
                before doing metaphysical ...


                one day fixing things up
                painting
                sit down dinner table, talk what we want to do as a a group or individually
                draw a little piocture

                doenst need to be a grandiose thing at the start
                we can ... and collaborate
                if we wanna do this? how to to that.

                painting exercise:
                huge canvas and we all complete each other&lsquo;s moves

                collaborative fun,
